Boolean
simple directly after; Next (1, 2) where 1 and 2 are call/assignment/read/print statements 
Next(s1, s2) where s1 is a conditional stmt
Next(s1, s2) where s1 is at the end of a conditional block
To consider different levels of nesting and test whether Next is functioning correctly, especially while loops.

Incorrect:
	- Next(s1, s1) should not be possible as stmtlists cannot be empty (not sure if invalid or incorrect)
Invalid: 
	- too many params
	- too little params
	- unknown char inside param
