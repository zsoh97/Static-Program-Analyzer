source code considerations:
Pattern-if:
if-condition statements with only variables
if-condition statements with only IDENT/varnames
if-condition statements with only constants
if-condition statements varying variables/constants/IDENTS
Pattern-while:
while-condition statements with only variables
while-condition statements with only IDENT/varnames
while-condition statements with only constants
while-condition statements varying variables/constants/IDENTS
can vary varname as synonym
Query construction:
Select-cl can return attrRef/BOOLEAN/tuple(with attrRef and synonym variation) and synonym
synonym in select clause can be related or non-related to pattern query
entRef : synonym | ‘_’ | ‘"’ IDENT ‘"’
first param wildcard/IDENT/variable(synonym)
Incorrect:
IDENT not in source

semantically invalid:
1st param stmt/print/read/if/while/prog_line synonym

syntacticalyl Invalid:
param 2 and 3(if-only) is IDENT/constant/variable(synonym)
wrong number of params
invalid param, i.e. attrRef as param
expression as 1st param or any other param
